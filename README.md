# Telangana-Growth-Analysis
**Project Overview:**

Imagine me, working alone, helping a state get better using data! Telangana, a state that wants to be open and smart, joined forces with the CodeBasics team to make this happen.

**Goal:**

My mission was simple: I wanted to use numbers and facts to make Telangana a better place to live and work. I looked at things like how people buy vehicles, what the government earns from papers, and where people invest their money.

**Important Things I Found:**

**More Places to Make Money:** I saw that most money comes from a few big cities. That's good, but it's also risky. So, I suggested finding new places to make money.

**Helping Small Places Grow:** I found small cities that are doing well. I said, "Let's help them grow even more." I want to give them new jobs and teach new things.

**The Best Month for Buying vehicles:** Did you know October is the best time to buy a vehicles? I said, "Let's make it even better." I want to give people cool deals and new cars.

**Fixing Places Where Fewer vehicles Are Sold:** Some places aren't selling many vehicles. I want to know why and make it better. I'm making a special team to do this.

**Electric Cars are Cool:** I also saw more people are buying electric cars. That's good for the Earth! I want even more people to buy them. So, I'm giving cool rewards and building places to charge them up.

**What I Hope to Do:**

My ideas will help Telangana grow and be a great place for everyone. I want to make sure more places make money, help small cities become big, sell lots of cars in October, and make electric cars popular.

I want to say thanks to the CodeBasics team for provide this challenge and to the Telangana government for sharing their data.
